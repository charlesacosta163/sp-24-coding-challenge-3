# Subset.js

The program takes an array of integers and a target sum as input. It iterates through the array and checks whether there exists a subset of the array elements that adds up to the target sum. It does so without using recursion or dynamic programming. If such a subset exists, the program prints out the subset. Finally, it returns true if a subset with the given sum exists; otherwise, it returns false.
